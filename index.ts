//What is TypeScript?
// TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

// This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.
// TypeScript being a "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.

// Why should I use TypeScript?
// JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.

// In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.

// TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.

// For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.

// TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// TypeScript Compiler
// TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript using a compiler.

// TypeScript being converted into JavaScript means it runs anywhere that JavaScript runs!

// Installing the Compiler
// TypeScript has an official compiler which can be installed through npm.
